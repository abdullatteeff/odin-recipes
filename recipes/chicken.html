    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable Oil (ghee)</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Ginger</li>
        <li>Chili</li>
        <li>Tumeric</li>
        <li>Salts</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large skillet. Fry potatoes in hot oil until brown. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain and set aside.</li><br><br>
        <li>Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the skillet and fry onions, garlic, and fresh ginger until onion is soft and golden. Add chili, pepper, turmeric, cumin, salt, and tomatoes. Fry, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes. Stir in yogurt, mint, ground cardamom, and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if the mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>When mixture is thick and smooth, add chicken and stir well to coat. Cover and cook over very low heat until chicken is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. There should only be a little very thick gravy left when the chicken is finished cooking. If necessary cook uncovered for a few minutes to reduce the gravy.</li>
